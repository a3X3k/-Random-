# XML

* HTML is a language that describes how information is displayed on the screen in the web browser and XML describes how data is organized, stored and retrieved from memory.&#x20;
* XML is simply text where XML files simply assign tags to data that will be meaningful to the application that needs access to a specific set of data.&#x20;
* By writing XML files for specific tasks and for specific types of data, many data files can be imported to an application for manipulation.&#x20;
