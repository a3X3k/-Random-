# XML

HTML is a language that describes how information is displayed on the screen in your web browser and XML describes how data is organized, stored and retrieved from memory.&#x20;

XML is simply text. There are no calculations done nor any type of display of information taking place.&#x20;

XML files simply assign tags to data that will be meaningful to the application that needs access to a specific set of data.&#x20;

By writing XML files for specific tasks and for specific types of data, many data files can be imported to an application for manipulation.&#x20;

The resulting data can then be displayed based on a HTML style sheet.
